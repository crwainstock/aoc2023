// DAY 6 -- Wait For It
// https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/6

// As part of signing up, you get a sheet of paper (your puzzle input) that lists the time
// allowed for each race and also the best distance ever recorded in that race.
// To guarantee you win the grand prize, you need to make sure you go farther in each race than
// the current record holder.

// The boats are much smaller than you expected - they're actually toy boats, each with a big button
// on top. Holding down the button charges the boat, and releasing the button allows the boat to move.
// Boats move faster if their button was held longer, but time spent holding the button counts against
// the total race time. You can only hold the button at the start of the race, and boats don't move until
// the button is released.

// For example:

// Time:      7  15   30
// Distance:  9  40  200
