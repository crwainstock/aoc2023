// Day 4: Scratchcards

// The Elf leads you over to the pile of colorful cards. There, you discover dozens of scratchcards,
// all with their opaque covering already scratched off. Picking one up, it looks like each card has two
// lists of numbers separated by a vertical bar (|): a list of winning numbers and then a list of numbers
// you have. You organize the information into a table (your puzzle input).

// As far as the Elf has been able to figure out, you have to figure out which of the numbers you have
// appear in the list of winning numbers. The first match makes the card worth one point and each match
// after the first doubles the point value of that card.
