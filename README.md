I've been googling for resources that might be useful, and ChatGPT has been really helpful for explaining bits of code and how to best use different methods to achieve what I need to do.

With Day 2, I also relied heavily on this great example from [LuBernardino](https://github.com/LuBernardino/AdventOfCode/tree/main/2023/Day2).
